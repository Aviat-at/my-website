Keeping humans in the loop matters most when stakes are high. In this post I walk through the
workflow I used to automate incident response without removing engineering judgment.

## Build trust before full automation

Start with **read-only automation** that collects diagnostics and enriches timelines. Once the
team trusts the data, graduate to runbooks that can be triggered with explicit approvals.

### A simple Slack trigger

```bash
/incident create "API latency spike" --service checkout --severity sev2
```

## Measure the outcomes

Track the impact of automation on **mean time to recovery** and analyst workload. You should see
fewer escalations and clearer ownership hand-offs.
